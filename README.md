# 🧪 React + TypeScript + Vite Template

This repository serves as a **starter kit for building modern React applications** using [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/), [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/), and [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.dev/). It's tailored for developers who want a **quick, clean, and scalable setup** — perfect for personal projects, side experiments, or rapid prototyping.

By cloning this template, you skip the hassle of repetitive setup work. All core dependencies, development tools, and style systems are already integrated — just install the packages and start coding.


## ⚡️ Features

- ✅ **React + TypeScript + Vite**: A blazing fast dev experience with hot module reloading and type safety out of the box.
- 🎯 **ESLint configuration**: Linting support with optional strict type-checking and stylistic rules for clean, maintainable code.
- 🎨 **shadcn/ui integrated**: Preconfigured for building accessible and beautiful UI components using Tailwind CSS and Radix UI.

  ## 📁 Project Goals
