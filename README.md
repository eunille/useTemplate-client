# 🧪 React + TypeScript + Vite Template

This repository serves as a **starter kit for building modern React applications** using [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/), [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/), and [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.dev/). It's tailored for developers who want a **quick, clean, and scalable setup** — perfect for personal projects, side experiments, or rapid prototyping.

By cloning this template, you skip the hassle of repetitive setup work. All core dependencies, development tools, and style systems are already integrated — just install the packages and start coding.


## ⚡️ Features

- ✅ **React + TypeScript + Vite**: A blazing fast dev experience with hot module reloading and type safety out of the box.
- 🎯 **ESLint configuration**: Linting support with optional strict type-checking and stylistic rules for clean, maintainable code.
- 🎨 **shadcn/ui integrated**: Preconfigured for building accessible and beautiful UI components using Tailwind CSS and Radix UI.
- 🧰 **Utility-first setup**: Includes essential development tools and conventions so you don’t need to spend time wiring things up.
- 💡 **Pre-installed dependencies**: Everything you need to build scalable, performant apps is already here — just run `npm install`.

  ## 📁 Project Goals

- 🧪 Provide a **reliable boilerplate** for personal and freelance projects.
- 🧼 Encourage **consistent code quality** with linting, type safety, and folder structure conventions.
- ⚙️ Make it easy to **extend or customize** for different needs (e.g., APIs, authentication, state management).
- 🧱 Set a foundation for **larger-scale apps** that can grow over time.

## 🚀 Getting Started
