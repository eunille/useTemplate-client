# 🧪 React + TypeScript + Vite Template

This repository serves as a **starter kit for building modern React applications** using [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/), [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/), and [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.dev/). It's tailored for developers who want a **quick, clean, and scalable setup** — perfect for personal projects, side experiments, or rapid prototyping.

By cloning this template, you skip the hassle of repetitive setup work. All core dependencies, development tools, and style systems are already integrated — just install the packages and start coding.
